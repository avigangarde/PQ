Task-1  Bank Customer Churn Prediction
The task is to train a machine learning model to predict whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) or not based on various customer attributes and banking behavior. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Task-2 Email Spam Detection
The objective of this project is to create an email spam detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to classify incoming emails. By training the model on a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails, we aim to develop an accurate and efficient spam detector that can reliably identify and categorize emails based on their content and characteristics.

Task-3 Startup Success Rate Prediction
The task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the success rate of startups based on various attributes and features. Startup success rate prediction involves analyzing factors such as funding, team composition, industry, market trends, and other relevant variables to estimate the likelihood of a startup's success. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the success or failure of startups, assisting entrepreneurs, investors, and stakeholders in making informed decisions.
